# This is one way that you can trick SQL into completing its phrase...

" OR ""="

# When we stick this together with our SQL statement...

'SELECT * FROM users WHERE username="' + req.body.username + '" AND password="' + req.body.password + '"'

# It becomes this:
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username="whatever" AND password="" OR "" = "";

# Because 'empty string' is equal to 'empty string', SQL evaluates that to be "TRUE"...
# ...which makes the statement ask 'is password TRUE (exist, not null)
# ...and the answer to that is yes for EVERY user, so we get...everyone's data D:
